        h1 New Workspace Item Variants 
        p A new workspace is required to manage items and BOMs that are specific for a given variant. These item variants will refer to the given base item to allow for data reuse by using derived fields, but will also have additional fields that define a variant (i.e. color, material, dimeions, serial #, ...). Customers can choose any properties they like for these variant specific properties, the application will adjust accordingly.
